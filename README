			Programming Language Examples

Inspired by the experience of using Skiena's "Programming Challenges" book to
learn new languages.

The same program will be implemented in multiple languages (e.g. Ruby, Python,
Javascript, Haskell, Go) in a (hopefully) idiomatic fashion in order to 
highlight differences between the languages.

Note that while an effort has been made to use idiomatic code, the emphasis
has been on writing *reusable* code, not one-liners or other obfuscated
nonsense.
